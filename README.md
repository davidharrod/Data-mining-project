Data Mining Project: Stock Predictor
# Core Concept
This project use gbdt to predict whether the stock price is going up. Understanding the difficulty of predicting the exact number of stock price, we simlpify the task by representing the question as a classification problem.
# Dataset
We obtain our dataset on kaggle. The csv file is in ./data.
# Performance
We use default settings to create gbdt model so as to simplify the process. The preformance of our model is shown as below:

We admmit that the performance of our model is far from perfect. We suggest that you can try to modify the model's parameters or obtain more data in order to improve the precision performance of the model.
